    <h2>About RebuyMart</h2>
    <p>RebuyMart is a demonstration of a dropshipping storefront built around products with high repeat purchase rates. Instead of trying to appeal to everyone, we focus on categories that research shows customers come back for regularly. By doing so, dropshipping businesses can build consistent revenue and stronger customer relationships.</p>
    <h3>Why Focus on Repeat Purchases?</h3>
    <p>Research from Shopify’s 2025 ecommerce retention guide highlights that some product categories enjoy far higher repeat purchase rates than others. For instance, the CBD industry has an impressive 36.2% repeat purchase rate, while niche high‑performance sports accessories like Onewheel parts achieve around 33%【357544231359812†L222-L225】. Consumables such as meal deliveries and nutritional supplements drive repeat purchase rates of about 29%【357544231359812†L229-L231】 and subscription‑friendly business models encourage customers to reorder regularly【357544231359812†L236-L240】. Metrilo’s customer retention analysis similarly notes that meal deliveries and supplements outperform other categories, with repeat rates around 29%, and that CBD products top the chart at 36.2%【131321632082388†L139-L159】.</p>
    <p>At the other end of the spectrum, products with limited repeat need – for example one‑off fashion items or tea – tend to have much lower repeat purchase rates, often around 20%【357544231359812†L229-L233】. By focusing our assortment on consumables and accessories that fit into customers’ daily routines, RebuyMart mirrors a strategy proven to encourage loyalty.</p>
    <h3>What Is Dropshipping?</h3>
    <p>Dropshipping allows merchants to sell products without carrying inventory. When a customer places an order, we forward it to a third‑party supplier who ships the product directly to the customer. This model reduces upfront costs and risk, making it ideal for small businesses and side hustles. Our curated selection means suppliers handle storage and shipping, while we concentrate on marketing and customer experience.</p>
